== Python Best Buy API Wrapper ==

This is a small python wrapper implementation for BestBuy API. The Wrapper not
complete by any means. As of now, it only supports the calls to the Products API
and Categories API. Locations and Reviews API are in the making.

The wrapper doesn't assume any design requirements on the user end. Queries to
the API's are done similar to what you put in the browser with the convenience
of having python prepare for you the query, url, and interpret the response.
